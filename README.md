### **Score Tracking**
   - The contract keeps track of the player’s and computer’s scores, allowing for multiple rounds with cumulative scoring.

### **Round-Based System**
   - Players can continue playing through multiple rounds, with the game state and scores automatically updating and resetting after each round.
